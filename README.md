## A little Java app made to observe the Sky and animate it at any given time.
This project was the main one of the second semester of my first year at EPFL, in the course "Practice of Object-Oriented Programming".  
It was the biggest project I have ever done in Computer Science, and it taught me a lot on how to manage and realize such projects.  
It was made with Nicolas Szwajcok, my teammate for the whole semester.
